News/GnusFilter version 0.5
============================
News::GnusFilter is a pure-Perl package for scripting an inline message 
filter. The filter adds "Gnus-Warning:" headers when presented with 
evidence of atypical content or formatting for usenet messages.  

News::GnusFilter should be drop-in compatible with other newsreaders that 
are capable of filtering a usenet posting through an external application
prior to display.

A sample script is provided in the ./gnusfilter file.
